# Tokyo Honey Pot

## Objective

The Detection Lab project aimed to establish a controlled environment for simulating and detecting cyber attacks. The primary focus was to ingest and analyze logs within a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system, generating test telemetry to mimic real-world attack scenarios. This hands-on experience was designed to deepen understanding of network security, attack patterns, and defensive strategies.

## Skills Learned

- Advanced understanding of SIEM concepts and practical application.
- Proficiency in analyzing and interpreting network logs.
- Ability to generate and recognize attack signatures and patterns.
- Enhanced knowledge of network protocols and security vulnerabilities.
- Development of critical thinking and problem-solving skills in cybersecurity.
- Created automated alert system to evaluate threats using their MD5 Hash and comparing it to Virustotal API. 

### Tools Used
- Wazuh
- Virustotal
- DigitalOcean
- Shuffle
- Shuffler.io
- TheHive
- Sysmon
